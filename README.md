# xTokenize
xTokenize is a platform for tokenizing the value that the community has. 
By combining NFT on XRPL, we will be able to add value to the community we have built to the XRPL network.

xTokenize Platform will also serve the people as the XRPL Projects Hub where the most important information about all the XRPL Projects are aggregated, validated and summarized.

What problems will xTokenize solve?


Focus FCX project has been in existence since over one year. During this time we discovered that the communication is real barrier and problematic entry threshold for thousands of people. English language is indeed worldwide known, however many people do not properly understand it.
Especially from Asia or Africa region, even in Europe people have some difficulties to understand messages in English. We could expand the east site of the world because we gained few excellent ambassadors who were able to communicate information about Focus FCX in their native language. We know that there is huge potential locked in the community and thanks xTokenize Platform it can be unlocked.
