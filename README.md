What problems will xConnect solve?


Focus FCX project has been in existence since over one year. During this time we discovered that the communication is real barrier and problematic entry threshold for thousands of people. English language is indeed worldwide known, however many people do not properly understand it.
Especially from Asia or Africa region, even in Europe people have some difficulties to understand messages in English. We could expand the east site of the world because we gained few excellent ambassadors who were able to communicate information about Focus FCX in their native language. We know that there is huge potential locked in the community and thanks xConnect Platform it can be unlocked.
